<p style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;font-family:cursive;">India's largest saline wetland, the Sambhar Lake is also a designated
Ramsar Site (recognized wetland of international importance) attracting
tens of thousands of flamingos and other migratory birds from northern
Asia and Siberia from November to February. When the monsoon arrives
in the month of July, the lake erupts with joy with the chirping cacophony
of the avian species the most common being coots, black-winged stilts,
sandpipers and redshanks.<br>
In addition one can also find foxes and blue bulls roaming freely in the
24000 hectare area. <br><br>
The civilization of the quaint salt town, Sambhar, goes back to the
legendary epic of Mahabharata; mentioned as part of the territory of the
demon king Vrishparva and as the place where the wedding of the
daughter of priest Sukracharya, Devayani, and King Yayati took place.
Historical records reveal that the town of Sambhar was founded by Raja
Vasudev of the Chauhan dynasty in 551 AD. <br>
Over time, the Sindhias, Marathas and Mughals ruled it and in 1709, it
was retrieved by the Rajputs. The rulers of Jaipur and Jodhpur jointly
owned the lake, and who in 1870 leased it to the British.
The name, Sambhar, stems from the 2500 years old tutelary deity,
Shakambhari, of the Chauhan Rajputs (Prithviraj Chauhan).
The colonial time infrastructure here includes heritage buildings, old
salt museum, trolley train and the Circuit House.</p>
