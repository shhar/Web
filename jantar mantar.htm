<H2  style="font-family:serif;"><center>JANTAR MANTAR AND ITS HISTORY</center></H2>
<p style="font-size:125%; text-align:center; font-family:cursive;">Jantar Mantar is a testament of the architectural brilliance and astronomical innovations of the Rajput era. Built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh II - the founder of Jaipur city, the monument was completed in 1734. Maharaja Jai Singh II was a great scholar and had keen interest in astronomy. The name is derived from Sanskrit language - ‘Jantar’ from ‘yantra’, meaning instrument or machine, and mantar from mantrana meaning to consult or calculate. Therefore, in literal translation, Jantar Mantar means the ‘instrument used for calculation'. Jantar Mantar in Jaipur was restored several times during the British colonial rule. In the year 1948, it was declared a national monument. It was again restored in 2006. Jantar Mantar is managed under the Archeological Sites and Monuments Act of Rajasthan since 1961, and protected as a National Monument of Rajasthan since 1968.</p>

Each of these astronomical instruments carries an astronomical scale, generally marked on the marble inner lining. Bronze tablets, bricks and mortar, were also used in the construction of these instruments. This stone observatory includes complex instruments whose settings and shapes are scientifically designed, illustrating the glorious past of Medieval Indian astronomy.
