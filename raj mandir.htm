<p style="font-size:125%; text-align:center;font-family:cursive;"> Raj Mandir Cinema is a movie theatre in Jaipur in Rajasthan state in India. One of the most famous spots in Jaipur is the Raj Mandir Cinema. A single-screen experience, done up with a royal and luxurious architecture, the cinema holds a special place in the Pink City. 
<br>Watching a Hindi movie is an amazing experience at this cinema, and booking your seat in advance is always a good idea. It was established in 1976. An asymmetrical exterior design helps the theater stand apart. Inside, the extravagantly finished roof, grand chandeliers, and a rising staircase next to the lobby lend an old world charm to the place.Located just off MI road, a Jaipur trip cannot be considered complete without a visit to the Raj Mandir.Known for its large size as well as opulent and meringue interiors, Raj Mandir remains an important part of the tourist circuit, and thus usually remains full despite its size.</p>
